# Nylas Mail Markdown

This is a plugin for composing emails in Nylas Mail using Markdown. It is a fork from [nylas/N1-Markdown-Composer](https://github.com/nylas/N1-Markdown-Composer) that I updated to work on newer versions of Nylas Mail.

This is most likely a very hacky solution, as I don't know exactly what I was doing (trial and error ftw!) -- so it's probably rather unstable.

Below is the readme from the original repo.
